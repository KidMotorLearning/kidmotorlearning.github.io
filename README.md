## Lab Description 
Have you ever wondered why it takes humans much longer than other mammals to move independently around the world? We are working on a series of research studies exploring motor learning in children. Using interactive video games, we are investigating childrenâ€™s ability to accurately learn a novel motor task when given different types of information about their performance. Understanding the age at which children are able to learn from various consequences of their movement will give insight into how the brain matures throughout childhood.
